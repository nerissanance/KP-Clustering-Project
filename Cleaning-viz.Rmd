The purpose of this file is to clean (as needed) as do some preliminary descriptive stats and visualizations on our variables of interest.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(rio)


data <- import("./data/heart.csv")
head(data)
names(data)


#number of unique values in each column:
sapply(data, function(col){length(unique(col))})

#amount of missingness in each variable:
sapply(data, function(col){table(is.na(col))})


```

## Visualization


```{r plots}



```
