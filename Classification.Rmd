#Classifcation


Nerissa to edit this code:
```{r setup, eval=FALSE}


#### CART ####
# install the package mda if you haven't before loading the library
# To install the package: install.packages("tree")
library(tree)

# first argument: The left-hand-side (response) should be either a numerical vector when 
# a regression tree will be fitted or a factor, when a classification tree is produced. 
# The right-hand-side should be a series of numeric or factor variables separated by +. The "."
# here is a simplified coding for all predcitors in the data x1+x2+...+x30
# second argument: your data set
# third argument subset: An expression specifying the subset of cases to be used (here we provide
# the index of the training set)

# train the tree using training set
out.tre<-tree(as.factor(y)~., data, subset=id.tr)

# plot the tree
plot(out.tre)
text(out.tre)

# predict grouping of training set using the model built by training set
G.tr.tre<-predict(out.tre, data.frame(X[id.tr,]), type="class")
sum(G.tr.tre != G.tr) / length(G.tr)

# predict grouping of testing set using the model built by training set
G.te.tre<-predict(out.tre, data.frame(X[-id.tr,]), type="class")
sum(G.te.tre != G.te) / length(G.te)



```
